# Office Door

This is the first door I've every made.  I wanted to try out something and since I'm primarily the only person to see
or use my office door I thought this would be a safe place to try something different.

This door is constructed purely out of Baltic Birch plywood.  I laminated strips of Baltic Birch plywood into "boards"
and then constructed my door out of that.
