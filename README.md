# WoodWorking Wiki
The WoodWorking Wiki is a log, or journal, of my explorations into woodworking.  By no means am I a professional or even an
amateur.  Think of me as more like an 8 year old with a brick of firecrackers and a box of matches.

Note: This is my first attempt to use gitbook as well as my first attempt to truly "document" what I'm doing with
markdown.  Wish me luck!
