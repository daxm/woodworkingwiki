# Bird Houses

Flickers migrate through the area where I live.  They like to next in hollowed out wood (or they will make a hollow in
soft or rotten wood).  This includes the eves on my house and out building!  Instead of shooing them away I decided to
build some bird houses for them to use instead of drilling holes into my buildings.

I did this project prior to starting this wiki so essentially all I have is some pictures.  I'd like to return to this
project and build some more bird houses so I'll have better documentation in the future.

What I can say is that the instructions I found were off of the Internet and suggested using 1 1/2 inch material for the
house walls.

I don't remember the dimensions but I do believe the side walls are a single width 2x8 board.  The front, back, bottom,
and top are joined 2x8 boards cut down to desired width.

Notice the "lines" along the sides of the houses?  That is a dado cut on the inside of the walls.  This cut provides 
traction, or a holding place, for the nesting birds.

I don't have a bandsaw so the sloped roof cut was done with a handsaw.
