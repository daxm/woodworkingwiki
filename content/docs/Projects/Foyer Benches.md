# Foyer Benches

I wanted to try a few things.
1.  I wanted to build a furniture object using only construction grade materials (AKA 2x4s)
1.  I wanted to try out this vinegar and steel wool stain.

So, I decided to build a bench for the foyer in my house.  While I'm at it, I might as well build 2 of them!

This project was finished prior to the creation of this wiki so this is for historical purposes only.

I don't have any of the build documented except the staining and finishing of the benches.
