# Sleep In Heavenly Peace Headboard Jig

The non-profit organization Sleep In Heavenly Peace (SHP) builds bunk beds for children who do not have a bed.  I built
a prototype jig for their headboard assembly.

This project was done long before I started this wiki so this is historical information only.

The dimensions for the jig were written on the jig itself.  I felt I should grab a copy of them before the jig gets
any more use.
