# African Mahogany

I have 2 pieces of African Mahogany that are each about 1 foot long.  I've rounded all the edges on one face so that the tests can show how they perform on edge grain.

My goal is to evenly divide each piece of wood with painter's tape, front and back, so that I can have essentially 4 "sections" of each board to test on.

My tests are categorized as follows:
* Stain wood or just stain wood filler.  This means do I seal the wood before or after applying the stain.  (Both of these use cases will come after using wood filler.)
* Which stain to use (testing Gunstock and Dark Mahogany stains).
* Sand only or use a finishing plane.

## Test Setup Summary
Each "section" of the boards will be numbered (1-8).  Here are my tests by section.
* Board Section 1:
  1. Sand to a 220 grit level.
  1. Pre-seal the wood prior to wood filler and staining.
  1. Use the gunstock stain.
* Board Section 2:
  1. Sand to 220 grit level.
  1. Use wood filler and stain.  Then seal the wood.
  1. Use the gunstock stain.
* Board Section 3:
Note: This is the backside of board section 1.
  1. Sand to 120 grit and then use smoothing plane.
  1. Pre-seal the wood prior to wood filler and staining.
  1. Use the gunstock stain.
* Board Section 4:
Note: This is the backside of board section 2.
  1. Sand to 120 grit and then use smoothing plane.
  1. Use wood filler and stain.  Then seal the wood.
  1. Use the gunstock stain.
* Board Section 5:
  1. Sand to a 220 grit level.
  1. Pre-seal the wood prior to wood filler and staining.
  1. Use the dark mahogany stain.
* Board Section 6:
  1. Sand to 220 grit level.
  1. Use wood filler and stain.  Then seal the wood.
  1. Use the dark mahogany stain.
* Board Section 7:
Note: This is the backside of board section 5.
  1. Sand to 120 grit and then use smoothing plane.
  1. Pre-seal the wood prior to wood filler and staining.
  1. Use the dark mahogany stain.
* Board Section 8:
Note: This is the backside of board section 6.
  1. Sand to 120 grit and then use smoothing plane.
  1. Use wood filler and stain.  Then seal the wood.
  1. Use the dark mahogany stain.

## Misc Notes
- These tests don't yet include the finish.  I'm still researching what finish I want to apply.
- Other tests I'd like to do would include using some sort of Tung/Teal oil.
